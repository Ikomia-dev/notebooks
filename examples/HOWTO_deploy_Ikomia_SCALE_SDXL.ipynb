    " # Guide to Deploying Vision Models in the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying Ikomia Workflows with `ikomia` and `ikomia-cli` Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When embarking on a computer vision project, one of the initial steps involves setting up your models and organizing them into workflows. However, a significant hurdle often arises when it's time to deploy these models efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying on GPUs can be a real headache. The setup is tricky, and the documentation? Even trickier, especially if you’re dealing with platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You've got to get a grip on all kinds of GPU configurations, sort out dependencies, and if things go sideways, you’re in for some serious troubleshooting. It can really drain your time and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Ikomia SCALE comes into play. It offers a streamlined platform that greatly simplifies the deployment process for computer vision models, eliminating the need for extensive coding and adaptation across different devices. Whether you're considering GPU serverless architectures like Google Cloud Platform or other prominent provider, SCALE ensures a smoother transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we provide a detailed guide on how to leverage the Ikomia ecosystem to your advantage:\n",
    "1.\t**Workflow Creation**: We begin by demonstrating how to utilize the Ikomia API to construct a workflow, setting the stage for deploying your computer vision model.\n",
    "2.\t**Deployment**: We then take you through the steps of deploying your model using the Gloud Cloud Platform as an example. These steps remain consistent across various platforms such as AWS or Scaleway, and regardless of the infrastructure, whether it's CPU or GPU.\n",
    "3.\t**Accessing Your REST API Endpoint**: Lastly, we explain how to access your REST API endpoint. This endpoint facilitates a seamless connection between your applications and the deployed model, ensuring efficient communication through standard HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth look at what Ikomia SCALE has to offer, feel free to visit the [official page](https://www.ikomia.ai/scale). Let's get started and simplify the process of deploying Computer Vision models!\n",
